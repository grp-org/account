## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peyronnet-group/account.git
   cd account
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-supabase-service-key>
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
     NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your-stripe-public-key>
     STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>
     ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Authentication

Users can sign up or log in through the app using Supabase's authentication methods. Ensure you have configured your Supabase project with the necessary settings for authentication.

### Subscription Management

The app uses Stripe to manage subscriptions. Users can select subscription plans, and the app will handle the checkout process using Stripe’s API. Ensure you set up the webhook endpoint `/api/webhooks` in your Stripe dashboard to handle events such as subscription updates.

### Deployment

The project is optimized for deployment on Netlify/Vercel. Follow these steps:

1. Link your repository to Netlify.
2. Set up the environment variables in Netlify's dashboard to match your local `.env` file.
3. Deploy the application.
